When a user chooses to view information about a department, a table is displayed showing the department names and their unique ids. When a user chooses to view information about roles, a table is displayed showing the job title, role id, department, and salary.

When a user chooses to add a department, they are prompted to enter the department's name, and it is added to the database. When a user chooses to add a role, they are prompted to enter the role's name, salary, and department, and it is added to the database. When a user chooses to add an employee, they are prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager, and the employee is added to the database.
